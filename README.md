## ⚠️ Before We Get Started

Before we get started there are a couple of things you should know:

  1. This is a *preview*.
  2. **This is a preview**.
  3. This. Is. A. Preview.

This is a preview. This code is not production-ready and all manner of Bad Things™ might happen if you use it. Things like:

  - Changes to interfaces and behavior that break your code upon upgrade.
  - Bugs, both garden variety and [Heisenbugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug), that crash your application.
  - Execution of the [HCF instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(computing)).

Likely there are bugs. If you find one, open an issue or—better yet—send me a pull request. Likely there will be changes. If you have a brilliant idea for one, let me know by opening an issue.

By using and abusing this software you are helping to improve it. This is greatly appreciated.
